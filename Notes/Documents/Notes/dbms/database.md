## DATABASE
> electronic place/systemwhere data is stored in a way that it can be easily accessed managed, and updated.

DBMS - like os manages resources similarly dbms manages data
    - To make real use Data,
    - DB -> store
    - set of program
        - access
        - add
        - update
        - delete
    > in short DBMS is a program that manages where to store data 
        and how to access it (set of program) efficiently and convenient
        (constraint access)

> (DBMS vs File system(old technique)) Problem not using any DBMS ie only using files etc.. 
    1. Data Redundancy & inconsistancy
    2. data accessing problem    
    3. Data isolation
    4. Integrity problems
    5. Atomicity problems.(if debitted then creaditted also)
    6. concurrent-access anomalies
    7. Security problems
