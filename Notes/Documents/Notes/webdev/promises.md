## classes

- an instance = object of classes
    - obj in classes and js obj(key,value pair) are different

- Date and Map classes;
    - new Map() ; var.set(), get()
- string is also a class as var.toLowerCase() etc we can use

- Promise class

  - promise gives you a promise that i will return given fn(thing etc) after given time
  - A Promise in Js is an obj that represents the eventual completion(or failure)of an asynchronous operation
  - fnReturnPromise().then(callback)
