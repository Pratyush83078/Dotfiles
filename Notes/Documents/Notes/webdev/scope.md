- this is a object
- in func this = window
- if we add new then this = blank obj
- Create prototype to save spaces as prototype is shared by all objects so for similar property,method
  use prototype(shared memory)
- arrow function vs simple function 
  - arrow fn takes value from parents scope ie in arrow function the value of this is depends on parent
- var b=Object.create(a);// now b's prototype becomes a's one now b shares same memory space 

- forEach

## ES6 classes 
  - New method to write classes, not only via function
  - ES6 classes: constructor, method, (extends, super[inheritence])(to extend a class ie class Admin extends user)
  - Prototype inheritence vs classical inheritence(another name of extends)
  - Encapsulation


## Some important terms

- callback
- callback hell
- promises 
- async,await & try catch
