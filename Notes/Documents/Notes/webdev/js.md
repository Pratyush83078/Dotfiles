library 
ffmpeg , mediasup, webrtc js ,

interpreted lang compile line by line at runtime
ie compiling the line running the line (there is one less step to do before running the code) 
  performance overhead
  More prone to runtime errors (after introducing typescript then this downside vanish)
 -bun is trying to make it better
but modern one are like java Mixed(compiled + interpreted or Bytecode-based) ie the source is compiled to intermediate bytecode, then interpreted or JIT compiled 
-in js frequently repeated code are  
    Parsing and Initial Interpretation:
    When JavaScript code is first loaded, it is parsed into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and then converted into bytecode, which is executed by an interpreter. This allows for quick initial execution.
    Profiling and Hot Spot Identification:
    As the code runs, the JIT compiler continuously monitors its execution, identifying "hot spots" â€“ sections of code that are executed frequently or consume significant processing time.
    Optimization and Machine Code Generation:
    When a hot spot is detected, the JIT compiler takes the corresponding bytecode and applies various optimization techniques. These optimizations can include inlining functions, eliminating redundant code, and specializing machine code for specific data types. The optimized code is then compiled into native machine code, which can be directly executed by the CPU.
    Execution of Optimized Code:
    Subsequent executions of the identified hot spots will use the optimized machine code, leading to significantly faster performance compared to interpreting the bytecode repeatedly.

2. dynamically typed
3. single threaded (one cpu at one time)
4. memory management (garbage, manually(c), rusy way) js do garbage collection;
